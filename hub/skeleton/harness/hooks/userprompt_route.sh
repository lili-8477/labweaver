[Self-driving mode is ON. The harness gate marker ~/.claude/.harness_active is present.]

Your ONLY action for this turn: invoke the /tick slash command via the SlashCommand tool. The orchestrator will read the user's latest message and:
  - if no progress.md exists in cwd, dispatch tick-bootstrap (scaffolds a new project from the instruction),
  - otherwise dispatch the next subagent in the priority chain (planner / executor / reviewer).

Do not answer the user's request directly. Do not run other tools first. The Stop hook will keep re-prompting /tick after each turn until ## Status: complete is written or the user pauses (touch ~/.claude/.tick_paused) or toggles self-driving Off.
